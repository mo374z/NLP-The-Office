        "You should understand the basics of PyTorch and how a training loop works before getting started. [This official PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html) serves as an excellent introduction. Familiarity with the workings of GPT2 might be useful but isn't required. The code has been written for clarity and not re-use. I'd advise refactoring it for actual projects. I've liberally taken bits from [Chris McCormick's BERT fine-tuning tutorial](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/), [Ian Porter's GPT2 tutorial](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/03/01/chapter-9.5-text-generation-with-gpt-2-and-only-pytorch.html.html) and the [Hugging Face Language model fine-tuning script](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v2.0.0/examples.html#language-model-fine-tuning) so full credit to them. Chris' code has pretty much provided the basis for this script - you should definitely check out his [blog](https://mccormickml.com/tutorials/).\n",

        "- Using the [nlp](https://huggingface.co/nlp/) library to load in the dataset and setting up the training workflow, which looks to streamline things rather nicely.\n",
        "- [Accumulated gradients](https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) - this gives larger effective batch sizes than Colab allows (GPT2 is a large model, and anything more than a batch size of 2 would be enough to get a CUDA out of memory error on Colab).\n",
        "- [Freezing layers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/1431). This is the process of only changing the parameters in selected layers, made famous by the [ULMFit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) process.\n",
        "- [Using 'past'](https://huggingface.co/transformers/quickstart.html#using-the-past) when generating text. This takes in the previous state when generating successive items of text. I didn't need it.\n",
        "- [Tensor packing](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/03/01/chapter-9.5-text-generation-with-gpt-2-and-only-pytorch.html.html). This is a neat way of fitting in as much training data in each batch. \n",
        "- [Hyperparameter search](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/using-hyperparameter-search-in-trainer/785/10). I settled quickly on values that seemed to produce decent values, without checking if they were optimal."
