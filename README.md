## Project Goal
Our objective is to apply methods of NLP in order to gain interesting insights into the show and its characters by only looking at “what the data says“. More specific, we analyze characters, relationships, sentiments and topics to identify speaking styles and developments. We want to provide additional insights both for fans and for people who did not watch
the show.

This repository also contiains scripts to train models to generate scenes (such as the scene above) and to classify
the speaker of a line. 

### To come...
We plan to upload the fine-tuned models to HuggingFace to make them easy accessible for everyone.#
